## SwitchVoid
My submission for a gamejam

The goal of the game is the navigate the 2D platformer levels by switching between different blocks using the [Shift] key to change between them.

#### The windows and web build have not been tested, they may be buggy or not work.

If later revisions are made in the game the debug keys will be removed, right now there are some debug keys,
 - "+" zoom camera in
 - "-" zoom camera out
 - "Enter" skip to next level

All builds are old and outdated
